Intro:
A checkbook is a container that holds a record of all the checks written by the owner. Our container, 
being computerized, will offer the user a variety of extra features so that they can find, organize, and 
better understand their check-based spending

This homework starts with two functional classes "date" and "check." These Classes are used to create a
"checkbook" class that stores these checks and contains many functions to interact with them. The main 
function applies the "checkbook" class and allows the user to use these functions made in the "checkbook"
header file.
